# BabyMonitor



This is a project where I developed a complete baby monitor system from scratch using Python and Raspberry Pi.
Implemented real-time video streaming, audio monitoring, and temperature monitoring features.
Designed and tested the system architecture for reliability and performance.
Overcame challenges in signal processing and motion detection algorithms.
Demonstrated problem-solving skills and attention to detail in the development process.
